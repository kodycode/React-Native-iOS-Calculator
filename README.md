## Description
This project was aimed to replicate the potrait iOS calculator's functionality and design while also learning about React-Native. For the most part, I've made it look close enough, however there are still some [quirks](https://github.com/kodycode/React-Native-iOS-Calculator/issues) I need to address. I haven't tested this on any android phones, but do write up any issues that occur.
